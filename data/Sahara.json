    "summary": "The Sahara Product Training document for Habib Bank Limited covers three plans: Sahara Plan A, B, and C. Sahara Plan A offers term Takaful coverage for death due to all causes, including terrorism. It is a straightforward, affordable plan with options ranging from Rs 125,000 to Rs 2,000,000 in coverage, with corresponding annual contributions. The enrollment age is 18-65 years, with a term of one year and a 30-day free look period. Sahara Plan B extends Plan A by offering hospitalization coverage, providing cash benefits for inpatient stays. This plan has additional income benefits and offers a daily hospital cash benefit ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000, depending on the chosen option. The enrollment age is 18-64 years, and it also includes a 30-day free look period. The plan includes a waiting period for sickness-related hospitalizations but none for accidents. Sahara Plan C is a dedicated women’s protection plan that covers death of the spouse and offers additional hospital cash benefits, including Caesarean section coverage. The coverage amounts range from Rs 960,000 to Rs 1,440,000, with daily hospital cash benefits for both normal and ICU stays. The enrollment age is 18-65 years, and the plan includes the same waiting period and free look period as other plans. The document outlines exclusions for term Takaful, hospital cash, and Caesarean section coverage, such as pre-existing conditions, suicide, and illegal acts. It also provides details on required claims documentation for each plan and outlines contact information for further assistance."
